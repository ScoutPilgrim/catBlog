    <p>This page is about our cat called Pupsik, who is the best cat ever!</p>
    <h2>The History of Maine Coons</h2>
      <p>The ancestral origins of the Maine Coon are unknown â€” there are only speculation and folk tales. One such folk tale involves Marie Antoinette, the Queen of France, who was executed in 1793. The story goes that before her death, Antoinette attempted to escape France with the help of Captain Samuel Clough. She loaded Clough's ship with her most prized possessions, including six of her favorite Turkish Angora cats. Although she did not make it to the United States, her pets safely reached the shores of Wiscasset, Maine, where they bred with other short-haired breeds and developed into the modern breed of the Maine Coon.</p>
